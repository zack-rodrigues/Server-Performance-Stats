https://roadmap.sh/projects/server-stats

A script server-stats.sh that can analyse basic server performance stats. You should be able to run the script on any Linux server and it should give you the following stats:

Total CPU usage

Total memory usage (Free vs Used including percentage)

Total disk usage (Free vs Used including percentage)

Top 5 processes by CPU usage

Top 5 processes by memory usage

Stretch goal: Feel free to optionally add more stats such as os version, uptime, load average, logged in users, failed login attempts etc.
